Title : MarkApp
Description : Waiting in a queue after buying stuff in a market for packing & billing can be tedious. We present an app that lets the user not to wait in queues anymore. The app eliminates the checkout procedure with the help of barcodes/QR codes placed in the cover of the products. The app scans the code and pays for the product at that instant a nd the amount is sent to the shop dealer's account. The user only needs to scan a code for entering and leaving the shop, connecting the user to the shop's account
